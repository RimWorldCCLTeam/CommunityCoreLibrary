    Wall attachment (PlaceWorker_WallAttachment) requires that the south* neighbouring cell has
    an edifice with the "Rock" or "Wall" graphic linker flags.  Should the "wall" be removed for
    up to 250 normal ticks (one rare tick), the thing will be destroyed and an alert will be raised
    for the player.
