    ThingClass: Building_HiddenStorage
    
    tickerType: None, Normal or Rare*
    
    This is building is an extension to RimWorld.Building_Storage which will disable calling
    of the Draw() and DrawGUIOverlay() on items stored in the building.  This means the item
    stored will not be drawn nor will it's label.  It otherwise functions exactly like the
    base class it is derived from.
    
    * Ticking does not need to be performed when storing items which only have a stack count
    of one (1), such as weapons and apparel.  If storage of items with stack counts larger
    than one is allowed then normal** or rare** ticking should be performed to reset the hiden
    status of the items render methods.  This needs to be done as the game will re-enable
    rendering if a partial stack is removed.
    
    ** Normal ticking only performs the check every 120 ticks, this is twice as fast as rare
    ticking but won't cause lag.  Choose your ticking method based on your needs.
