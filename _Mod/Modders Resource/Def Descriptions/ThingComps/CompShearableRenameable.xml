    ThingComp:  CompShearableRenameable
    
    Requires:   CompProperties_ShearableRenameable
    
    Using CompShearableRenameable allows you to specify a custom growth string for your resource,
    e.g. "chemical growth" on a boomalope which can be harvested for explosives, "venom fullness" on a
    snake, etc. This is in contrast to vanilla's CompShearable which will always display "wool growth"
    regardless of the resource harvested. Beyond that usage is identical to CompShearable and not
    specifying any string will default to the vanilla value for maximum compatibility and ease of use,
    simply do not specify a string if you don't need any custom text and it will act identical to
    CompShearable.
